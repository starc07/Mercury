1. Discord
</p>
<p class="ml-4">
Discord data is stored to make sure Moosic can operate, provide "premium" perks to certain
users
and allow servers to set their own settings.<br>
</p>
<p class="font-semibold text-gray-200 mt-4">
2. Patreon (this only applies if you are actively subscribed to one of our patreon
plans)
</p>
<p class="ml-4">
Patreon data is stored to make sure we can connect your Patreon pledge tier to Discord
and give
you the perks you bought to the right accounts and servers.

<div class="ml-4">
<p>• Any per-server settings you might have changed</p>
<p class="ml-4">
These are only saved if you change the default settings of Mercury in your server and
are needed to
make sure the settings you set persist over your period of time using Mercury within
your server.
</p>
<p class="mt-2">• The entirety of the queue in any server</p>
<p class="ml-4">
As soon as you play a song with Moosic we store a copy of your queue, this is to make
sure that if
Moosic has an outage, we can resume the song you were playing once Mercury has recovered.
It does not
matter if you have one or 800 songs queued, all songs will be saved.
